```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
head(flights)
```

```{r}
#1
count(filter(flights, is.na(dep_time)))

```
8255 flights have a missing dep_time. 
These rows might represent the flights that have been canceled. 

```{r}
#2
transmute(flights,
  dep_time,
  hour = dep_time %/% 100,
  minute = dep_time %% 100
)
```

```{r}
#(3)

```

```{r}
avg_delay <- flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(average_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

canceled_perday <- flights %>%
  filter(is.na(dep_time)) %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarise(canceled_per_day = n()) 

df <- merge(avg_delay, canceled_perday, by = c('year', 'month', 'day'))

df
#ggplot(aes(x = df$average_delay, y = df$canceled_per_day)) + geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(df) + geom_point(aes(x = average_delay, y = canceled_per_day))
```

The average delay and the number of flights canceled per day seem to be positively correlated.
